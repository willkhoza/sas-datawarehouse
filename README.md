#### Lindo Khoza, willkhoza@gmail.com
I will be working through SAS Data Warehousing concepts on Monika Wahi's book [Mastering SAS Programming for Data Warehousing](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-SAS-Programming-Data-Warehousing/dp/178953237X)

The goal of this repo is to independtly review and implement the application of designing and managing data warehouses as prescribed by the book.
